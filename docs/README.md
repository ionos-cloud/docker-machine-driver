# Introduction

## Overview

Docker Machine Driver is the official driver for Docker Machine to use with IONOS Cloud. It adds support for creating Docker Machines hosted on the IONOS Cloud.

[Docker Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine) lets you create Docker hosts on your computer and inside your own data center. It creates servers, installs Docker on them, then configures the Docker client to talk to them. For more information about Docker Machine, check the official [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/docker/machine).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
 
#### Installing Docker Machine

This Ionos Cloud plugin works with Docker Machine and with Rancher Machine as well. Before we continue, you will need to install [Docker Machine](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) or [Rancher Machine](https://github.com/rancher/machine/releases/).

#### Installing Go

The Ionos Cloud Docker Machine Driver is written in the Go programming language. Your system will need to have Go installed. Please refer to the [Go Install Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install) if you do not have Go installed and configured for your system.

Remember to set `$GOPATH` and update `$PATH`. The following are just examples using the `export` command, you will need to adjust the paths for your particular installation.

```text
export GOPATH=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

### Installing

#### Released Binaries

Check the [Release Page](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/docker-machine-driver/releases) and find the corresponding archive for your operating system and architecture. You can download the archive from your browser or you can follow the next steps:

```text
# Check if /usr/local/bin is part of your PATH
echo $PATH

# Download and extract the binary (<version> is the full semantic version): 
curl -sL https://github.com/ionos-cloud/docker-machine-driver/releases/download/v<version>/docker-machine-driver-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xzv

# Move the binary somewhere in your $PATH:
sudo mv ~/docker-machine-driver-ionoscloud /usr/local/bin

# See options for the driver to use with the Docker Machine
docker-machine create --help --driver ionoscloud
```

For Windows users, you can download the latest release available on [Release Page](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/docker-machine-driver/releases), unzip it and copy the binary in your `PATH`. You can follow this [official guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee537574(v=office.14).aspx) that explains how to add tools to your `PATH`. 

#### Local Version 

With the prerequisites taken care of, will need to run the following commands to install the Ionos Cloud Docker Machine Driver:

```text
git clone https://github.com/ionos-cloud/docker-machine-driver.git
```

After cloning the repository, you can build and install the driver itself:

```text
cd $DIRECTORY_PATH/docker-machine-driver
make install
```

When successful, we will end up with a newly created `docker-machine-driver-ionoscloud` binary in `docker-machine-driver/bin/` and in `$GOPATH/bin/`. 

Depending on how your `$PATH` is being set, you may need to copy the binary to `$PATH` in order to use the Docker Machine Driver. 

```text
sudo cp $DIRECTORY_PATH/docker-machine-driver/bin/docker-machine-driver-ionoscloud /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-ionoscloud
```

Note that the development version is a work-in-progress of a future stable release and can include bugs. Officially released versions will generally be more stable. Check the latest releases in the [Release Page](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/docker-machine-driver/releases).

### Usage

Before you start creating a Docker Machine with the Ionos Cloud Docker Machine Driver, you need to authenticate in your Ionos Cloud account. Check the steps in the [Authentication](usage/authentication.md) section.

For information about how to create a Docker Machine with Ionos Cloud Docker Machine Driver, check the [Create Machine](usage/create-machine.md) section.

For information about how to create a Docker Machine with Ionos Cloud Docker Machine Driver with [Swarm Mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), check the [Create Swarm](usage/create-swarm.md) section.

In order to see the available options and flags, check the [Options](usage/options.md) section.

For more information about Docker Machine commands on how to manage a machine, including examples, check the [Commands](usage/commands.md) section. 

For more details about possible issues, check the [Troubleshooting](usage/troubleshooting.md) section.
