# Introduction

## Overview

Rancher Driver is the official driver for Rancher Machine to use with Ionos Cloud. 

[Rancher Machine](https://github.com/rancher/machine) it is a fork of [Docker Machine](https://github.com/docker/machine) and it lets you create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers and inside your own data center. For more information about Rancher Machine, you can visit the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rancher/machine) and the [Official Documentation](https://rancher.com/).
                                                                 
## Getting started

### Prerequisites
 
#### Installing Rancher Machine

This Ionos Cloud plugin will only work with Rancher Machine. Before we continue, you will need to install [Rancher Machine](https://github.com/rancher/machine/releases/).

Rancher Machine requires to:

* allow inbound traffic to port 22 (SSH) to the node subnet.
* allow inbound traffic to port 2376 (Docker) to the node subnet.

#### Installing Go

The Ionos Cloud Rancher Driver is written in the Go programming language. Your system will need to have Go installed. Please refer to the [Go Install Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install) if you do not have Go installed and configured for your system.

Remember to set `$GOPATH` and update `$PATH`. The following are just examples using the `export` command, you will need to adjust the paths for your particular installation.

```text
export GOPATH=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

### Installing

#### Released Binaries

Check the [Release Page](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/rancher-driver/releases) and find the corresponding archive for your operating system and architecture. You can download the archive from your browser or you can follow the next steps:

```text
# Check if /usr/local/bin is part of your PATH
echo $PATH

# Download and extract the binary (<version> is the full semantic version): 
curl -sL https://github.com/ionos-cloud/rancher-driver/releases/download/v<version>/rancher-driver-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar -xzv

# Move the binary somewhere in your $PATH:
sudo mv ~/docker-machine-driver-ionoscloud /usr/local/bin

# See options for the driver to use with the Rancher Machine
rancher-machine create --help --driver ionoscloud
```

For Windows users, you can download the latest release available on [Release Page](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/rancher-driver/releases), unzip it and copy the binary in your `PATH`. You can follow this [official guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee537574(v=office.14).aspx) that explains how to add tools to your `PATH`. 

#### Local Version 

With the prerequisites taken care of, will need to run the following commands to install the Ionos Cloud Rancher Machine Driver:

```text
git clone https://github.com/ionos-cloud/rancher-driver.git
```

After cloning the repository, you can build and install the driver itself:

```text
cd $DIRECTORY_PATH/rancher-driver
make install
```

When successful, we will end up with a newly created `docker-machine-driver-ionoscloud` binary in `rancher-driver/bin/` and in `$GOPATH/bin/`. 

Depending on how your `$PATH` is being set, you may need to copy the binary to `$PATH` in order to use the Rancher Driver. 

```text
sudo cp $DIRECTORY_PATH/rancher-driver/bin/docker-machine-driver-ionoscloud /usr/local/bin/docker-machine-driver-ionoscloud
```

Note that the development version is a work-in-progress of a future stable release and can include bugs. Officially released versions will generally be more stable. Check the latest releases in the [Release Page](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/rancher-driver/releases).

### Usage

Before you start creating a Rancher Machine with the Ionos Cloud Rancher Driver, you need to authenticate in your Ionos Cloud account. Check the steps in the [Authentication](usage/authentication.md) section.
