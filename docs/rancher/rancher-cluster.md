# Rancher Cluster

IONOS Cloud Docker Machine Driver is compatible with [Rancher](https://rancher.com/).

## Installation

To install Rancher and Log in to Rancher UI, follow the first 3 steps in this [Quick Manual Setup](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/quickstart-manual-setup/).

You will create a Docker Container with the following command: 

```text
sudo docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --privileged rancher/rancher
```

To follow the output logs for the running container, use: 

```text
docker logs -f container-id
```

## Prerequisites

* Your IONOS Cloud account credentials: username and password
* A link to download the latest release of docker-machine-driver for your platform. Check the [Release Page](https://github.com/ionos-cloud/docker-machine-driver/releases) for the latest releases available. Find the corresponding one for your operating system and architecture. 
  
All you need to do is to copy the link location, which should look something like this: `https://github.com/ionos-cloud/docker-machine-driver/releases/download/v<version>/docker-machine-driver-<version>-linux-amd64.tar.gz `

* A web server accessible by your browser
